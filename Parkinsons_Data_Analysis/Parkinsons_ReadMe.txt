This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements, The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with Parkinson's Disease, according to "Target".

The dataset includes 22 attribues and 1 output attribue ("Target" attribute 17)
The 197 instances have been classified into one of 2 different classes based on presence of absence of the disease.
